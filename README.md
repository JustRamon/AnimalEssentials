### To-Do

1. /ae spawn (Spawns the desired animal, GUI!!!)
2. Ability to click the entity name in chat, after issuing /ae find <name>, to teleport to it.
3. Particles for /ae name | /ae kill
4. Make multiple players able to issue the same command at a time (HashMap?)
(5. XP-System)
6. Animal Protect
7. Fix cancelling of all tasks of the plugin (aka only cancel the task of the current command)
8. Replace a(n) with the correct thing
9. Define amount of kills (eg. /ae kill 6)

### Done

2. /ae reload (Reload the configuration file.)
3. /ae help (Show the help menu.)
